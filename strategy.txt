Absolutely. Here's a complete structural breakdown of your strategy with the updated 1:3 Risk–Reward Ratio and all components clearly defined:

📊 VWAP + MA Mean Reversion Strategy with ATR Stop Loss and 1:3 Risk–Reward
This intraday strategy captures short-term mean reversion opportunities by entering counter-trend trades when price temporarily deviates from VWAP, while still being aligned with the broader trend (via MA). It dynamically manages risk using ATR-based stop loss and profit targets at a 1:3 ratio.

🧱 1. Strategy Objective
Exploit intraday mean reversion setups where price is temporarily misaligned with VWAP but still within trend, and manage trades using volatility-based dynamic stops and targets.

🧮 2. Indicators Used
Indicator
Description
VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)
Real-time average price weighted by volume — resets every session, used as mean-reversion anchor
SMA (Simple Moving Average)
Trend filter — we use 14-period SMA to avoid counter-trend trades
ATR (Average True Range)
Volatility gauge over last 14 bars — used to size stop loss and target adaptively


📈 3. Trade Conditions
✅ Long Entry Criteria
·   	Close < VWAP → Price is undervalued vs intraday average
·   	Close > 14-SMA → Price still in uptrend (bullish bias)
✅ Short Entry Criteria
·   	Close > VWAP → Price is overvalued vs intraday average
·   	Close < 14-SMA → Price still in downtrend (bearish bias)
These filters ensure you buy pullbacks in an uptrend and sell rallies in a downtrend.

🛑 4. Stop Loss & Target Logic (1:3 Risk–Reward)
🔐 Stop Loss (1×ATR)
Position
Formula
Long
Stop = Entry − (1 × ATR)
Short
Stop = Entry + (1 × ATR)

🎯 Target (3×ATR)
Position
Formula
Long
Target = Entry + (3 × ATR)
Short
Target = Entry − (3 × ATR)

This means that for every ₹1 risked, you target ₹3 in reward.

⏱️ 5. Timeframe & Market Conditions

Enhanced 2-Candle Option Strategy: A Comprehensive Trading Framework
Core Strategy Foundation
The 2-candle theory represents a breakout identification system for index futures and options that combines multiple technical indicators to generate high-probability trades12. This strategy capitalizes on momentum continuation patterns identified through consecutive high-volume candles with proper technical confirmations.
Primary Entry Conditions
Long Positions (Call Options/Futures Buy):
·   	2 consecutive candles with volumes >50K (Bank Nifty) or >125K (Nifty) on 3-minute timeframe13
·   	Price above VWAP, SuperTrend, and VWMA simultaneously23
·   	RSI between 50-75 (optimal buying zone)45
·   	Open Interest showing long buildup or short covering67
·   	Entry on 3rd candle with stop-loss at 1st candle low12
Short Positions (Put Options/Futures Sell):
·   	2 consecutive candles with required volume thresholds (red/bearish candles)
·   	Price below VWAP, SuperTrend, and VWMA
·   	RSI between 25-40 (optimal selling zone)45
·   	Open Interest showing short buildup or long unwinding
·   	Entry on 3rd candle with stop-loss at 1st candle high
Enhanced Technical Indicator Framework
1. Multi-Indicator Confirmation System
VWAP Integration:
·   	Acts as dynamic support/resistance89
·   	Provides trend direction confirmation
·   	Entry signals when price breaks above/below VWAP with volume10
Parabolic SAR (0.02, 0.02, 0.2):
·   	Stop and Reverse signals for trend changes1112
·   	SAR dots above price = sell signal; below price = buy signal1314
·   	Excellent for trailing stop-loss management11
SuperTrend (10, 2):
·   	ATR-based trend following indicator1513
·   	Green line (below price) = bullish; Red line (above price) = bearish
·   	Provides clear trend direction with reduced noise11
VWMA (Volume Weighted Moving Average):
·   	Incorporates volume weighting for more accurate price representation1617
·   	Higher volume periods have greater influence on average1819
·   	Better than SMA for identifying true market sentiment17
2. Golden Crossover Enhancement
Golden Cross Trigger (Missing Element):
When both VWMA and SuperTrend cross VWAP simultaneously:
·   	Bullish Golden Cross: VWMA and SuperTrend cross above VWAP = Strong long signal20
·   	Bearish Golden Cross: VWMA and SuperTrend cross below VWAP = Strong short signal
·   	This combination can generate 100+ point rallies with proper timing20
Implied Volatility (IV) Analysis Framework
IV-Based Strategy Selection
Low IV Environment (VIX <15):
·   	Buy options when IV is undervalued2122
·   	Focus on long straddles and long strangles23
·   	Avoid selling premium strategies21
High IV Environment (VIX >25):
·   	Sell options to capture premium decay2122
·   	Implement iron condors and short straddles2324
·   	Use ratio spreads for directional bias22

Strike Selection Strategy (Missing Element)
ATM/ITM/OTM Selection Criteria
For Long Positions:
·   	ATM options: Highest delta, best for quick moves2526
·   	ITM options: Higher success probability, more expensive2728
·   	OTM options: Higher leverage, lower success rate2529
Optimal Selection:
·   	50% OI increase + 50% price increase: ATM/ITM long buildup (Buyer's paradise)
·   	50% OI increase + 50% price decrease: OTM puts for short buildup (Seller's paradise)
·   	OI decrease + price increase: ITM calls for short covering
·   	OI decrease + price decrease: Avoid trading, use only for hedging
World Markets Correlation (Enhanced Element)
Global Market Influence on Indian Options
Key Correlations:
·   	US Markets (S&P 500/Dow Jones): Strong positive correlation (0.4-0.6) with Nifty3031
·   	Asian Markets (Nikkei/Hang Seng): Moderate correlation (0.3-0.5)3132
·   	European Markets (FTSE): Moderate correlation during overlap hours3334
Trading Time Considerations:
·   	Pre-market analysis: Check SGX Nifty for gap indication33
·   	9:15-9:45 AM: Avoid 2-candle theory due to opening volatility3
·   	9:45 AM-2:30 PM: Optimal trading window12
·   	Post 2:30 PM: Increased volatility, reduce position size3
Risk Management Framework
Position Sizing and Risk Controls
Stop-Loss Management:
·   	Fixed stops: 1st candle high/low12
·   	Trailing stops: Use Parabolic SAR dots1112
·   	Time-based exits: Close positions before 3:15 PM for weekly options
Profit Targets:
·   	Scalping: 100-150 points within 15-20 minutes12
