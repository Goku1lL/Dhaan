- ⏱️ **Elapsed Time Counter** - Shows how long the current scan has been running
- 🔄 **Progress Percentage** - Real-time progress based on estimated completion time
- 📊 **Stocks Processed Counter** - Shows X/Y stocks processed during scan

### **2. Visual Progress Indicators**
- 📈 **Animated Progress Bar** - Visual representation of scan completion
- 🎨 **Color-coded Status** - Green (scanning), Orange (waiting), Gray (idle)
- ⚡ **Loading Spinners** - Active indicators during scanning phases

### **3. Next Scan Countdown**
- ⏰ **5-minute Countdown Timer** - Shows time until next scan starts
- 📅 **Automatic Scan Cycles** - Continuous scanning every 5 minutes
- 🔄 **Countdown Progress Bar** - Visual countdown representation

### **4. Enhanced Status Display**

- 📱 **Responsive Cards** - Dedicated progress section during active scanning
- 📊 **Universe Information** - Shows which universe is being scanned

## 📱 User Interface Elements

### **Header Status Card** (Always Visible)
Located in the "Last Scan" card, showing:
- **When Idle:** Last scan time and duration
- **When Scanning:** Live elapsed timer and progress
- **When Waiting:** Countdown to next scan

### **Progress Section** (Shown During Scanning)
Large progress card appears when scanning is active:
- **Status Header:** "Scanning... (X/Y stocks)" or "Next scan in X:XX"
- **Elapsed Timer:** Shows time since scan started
- **Progress Bar:** Visual completion indicator (0-100%)
- **Universe Info:** Currently selected stock universe

### **Visual Status Indicators**
- 🟢 **Green Background:** Active scanning in progress
- 🟠 **Orange Background:** Scanner active, waiting for next cycle
- ⚪ **Gray/Default:** Scanner idle/stopped

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation

### **Timer Accuracy**
- **Update Frequency:** Every 1 second for real-time updates
- **Progress Estimation:** Based on stocks count × 500ms per stock
- **Memory Efficient:** Timers automatically clean up when stopped

### **Progress Calculation**
```javascript
// Estimated duration based on universe size
const estimatedDuration = totalStocks * 500; // 500ms per stock
const progress = Math.min((elapsed / estimatedDuration) * 100, 95);
```

### **State Management**
- **scanStatus:** 'idle', 'scanning', 'waiting'
- **scanStartTime:** Timestamp when scan begins
- **scanElapsedTime:** Milliseconds since scan started
- **scanProgress:** Percentage completion (0-100)
- **stocksProcessed:** Estimated stocks analyzed
- **nextScanCountdown:** Seconds until next scan

## 🎮 How to Use

### **Starting a Scan**
1. Click **"START SCANNING"** button
2. **Progress card appears** immediately
3. **Timer starts** showing real-time progress
4. **Progress bar** fills as scan progresses

### **During Scanning**
- **Watch the timer** count up in real-time
- **Monitor progress bar** for completion status
- **See stocks processed** counter increment
- **Universe information** shows what's being scanned

### **Between Scans** (Waiting Mode)
- **Orange countdown timer** shows time to next scan
- **Progress bar** counts down from 5:00 to 0:00
- **Status shows** "Next scan in X:XX"
- **Scanner remains active** for continuous operation

### **Stopping the Scanner**
1. Click **"STOP SCANNING"** button
2. **All timers stop** immediately
3. **Progress section disappears**
4. **Returns to idle state**

## 📊 Performance Indicators

### **Scan Duration Estimates**
| Universe Size | Estimated Time | Visual Feedback |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 20 stocks | ~10 seconds | Fast progress |
| 50 stocks | ~25 seconds | Moderate progress |
| 100 stocks | ~50 seconds | Steady progress |
| 200+ stocks | ~100+ seconds | Patient progress |

### **Real-time Feedback**
- ✅ **Instant timer start** when scanning begins
- ✅ **Live progress updates** every second
- ✅ **Accurate countdown** for next scan
- ✅ **Visual state changes** for different phases

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Timer Not Starting?**
- Ensure scanning actually started (check for error messages)
- Refresh the page if timers seem stuck
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### **Progress Bar Stuck?**
- Progress estimates are based on universe size
- Large universes (200+ stocks) take longer
- Progress caps at 95% until actual completion

### **Countdown Not Working?**
- Countdown only shows when scanner is in "waiting" mode
- Check that scanning is actually active
- Next scan countdown resets when scan completes
